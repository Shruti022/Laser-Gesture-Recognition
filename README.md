With digital projectors becoming more affordable the use of Microsoft PowerPoint as a platform for delivering presentations has become increasingly popular. It is typical for the presenter to use a mouse or other similar device in order to manipulate a presentation, this usually means being stood in a position from which the host computer can be operated. It is also common for the person delivering the presentation to use a laser pointer in order to draw attention to certain parts of a slide. Design a system to allow the presenter the freedom to manipulate the slideshow without having to be in close proximity to the computer on which it is running to make the presentation more interactive, which can be achieved by using the laser pointer in a more traditional manner, in order to manipulate the slideshow.  Everyone loves listening to music on their laptops, but changing tracks is a difficult since one has to reach for the keyboard every time they want to change a song.
